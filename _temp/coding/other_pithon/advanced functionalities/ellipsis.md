In Python, the Ellipsis (represented as ...) is a built-in constant. It’s a special object representing an **unspecified or infinite number of arguments**.

- **Placeholder**: You can use it as a placeholder, for example, when you intend to fill in a Python function later on, but still want to have valid syntax. Many people use pass in such cases, but using ... can create minimal visual clutter. Here’s an example:

```python
def todo():
    ...
```

- **NumPy Slice Notation**: The most useful application of the ellipsis is in the NumPy library. With NumPy, you can slice multiple dimensions at once by using commas. Here’s an example:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([[[1],[2],[3]], [[4],[5],[6]]])
print(x[...])
```

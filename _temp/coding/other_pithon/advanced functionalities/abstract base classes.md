Abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python are a way to define a blueprint for classes that must implement certain methods or properties.

**Key characteristics of ABCs:**

1. **Abstract methods:** Abstract methods are methods that are declared in an ABC but do not have any implementation. This means that subclasses of the ABC must override these methods with their own implementations.
2. **Interface definition:** ABCs are used to define a set of mandatory methods that must be implemented by subclasses. This ensures that all objects of a particular type have the same basic functionality.
3. **Tool for code organization:** ABCs help to organize code by defining common interfaces for classes. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to reason about the behavior of different classes.

**Examples of using ABCs:**

1. **Shape class:** Consider an ABC for shapes that defines methods like `get_area()` and `get_perimeter()`. Subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` can inherit from this ABC and implement their own specific implementations of these methods.
2. **Payment class:** Imagine an ABC for payments that specifies methods like `process_payment()` and `get_status()`. Subclasses like `CreditCardPayment`, `DebitCardPayment`, and `PayPalPayment` can inherit from this ABC and implement their own specific logic for processing payments and determining the payment status.

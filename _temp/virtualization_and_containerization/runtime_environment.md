This refers to the environment in which an application or script is executed. In the context of Docker, `the runtime environment includes everything the application needs to run, including the system libraries, environment variables, and dependencies.` Docker packages these into a container, which can then be run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring that the application behaves the same way regardless of where it is run.

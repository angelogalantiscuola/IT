It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.\n","pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]}) # 2 rows 2 columns\n","fruits = pd.DataFrame([[30, 21]], columns=['Apples', 'Bananas']) # 1 row 2 columns\n","\n","# The dictionary-list constructor assigns values to the column labels, but just uses an ascending count from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) for the row labels. Sometimes this is OK, but oftentimes we will want to assign these labels ourselves.\n","pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], \n","              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},\n","             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])\n","# A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:\n","pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n","# A Series is, in essence, a single column of a DataFrame. So you can assign row labels to the Series the same way as before, using an index parameter. However, a Series does not have a column name, it only has one overall name:\n","pd.Series([30, 35, 40], index=['2015 Sales', '2016 Sales', '2017 Sales'], name='Product A')\n","# The Series and the DataFrame are intimately related. It's helpful to think of a DataFrame as actually being just a bunch of Series \"glued together\".\n","\n","# Reading data files\n","wine_reviews = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv\")\n","wine_reviews = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv\", index_col=0)\n","# We can use the shape attribute to check how large the resulting DataFrame is:\n","wine_reviews.shape\n","# We can examine the contents of the resultant DataFrame using the head() command, which grabs the first five rows:\n","wine_reviews.head()\n","# Save DataFrame to csv\n","wine_reviews.to_csv('wine_reviews.csv')\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Indexing, Selecting & Assigning"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Native accessors\n","# Native Python objects provide good ways of indexing data. Pandas carries all of these over, which helps make it easy to start with.\n","reviews = wine_reviews\n","reviews['country'][0]\n","\n","# Indexing in pandas\n","# The indexing operator and attribute selection are nice because they work just like they do in the rest of the Python ecosystem. As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. However, pandas has its own accessor operators, loc and iloc. For more advanced operations, these are the ones you're supposed to be using.\n","# Both loc and iloc are row-first, column-second.\n","\n","# To select the first row of data in a DataFrame, we may use the following:\n","reviews.iloc[0] # return the first row\n","# To get a column with iloc, we can do the following:\n","reviews.iloc[:, 0]\n","# The second paradigm for attribute selection is the one followed by the loc operator: label-based selection. In this paradigm, it's the data index value, not its position, which matters.\n","# For example, to get the first entry in reviews, we would now do the following:\n","reviews.loc[0, 'country'] # return one cell: row 0 column country\n","\n","cols = ['country', 'variety']\n","df = reviews.loc[:99, cols]\n","# or\n","cols_idx = [0, 11]\n","df = reviews.iloc[:100, cols_idx]\n","\n","# When choosing or transitioning between loc and iloc, there is one \"gotcha\" worth keeping in mind, which is that the two methods use slightly different indexing schemes.\n","# iloc uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,9. loc, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,10.\n","\n","# Manipulating the index\n","reviews.set_index(\"title\")\n","\n","# Conditional selection\n","reviews.loc[(reviews.country == 'Italy') & (reviews.points >= 90)]\n","reviews.loc[reviews.country.isin(['Italy', 'France'])]\n","reviews.loc[reviews.price.notnull()]\n","\n","# Assigning data\n","reviews['critic'] = 'everyone'\n","reviews['index_backwards'] = range(len(reviews), 0, -1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Summary Functions and Maps"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Summary functions\n","# Pandas provides many simple \"summary functions\" (not an official name) which restructure the data in some useful way. \n","reviews.points.describe()\n","reviews.points.mean()\n","reviews.taster_name.unique()\n","reviews.taster_name.value_counts()\n","\n","# Maps\n","# A map is a term, borrowed from mathematics, for a function that takes one set of values and \"maps\" them to another set of values.

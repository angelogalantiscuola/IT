# Flask request

## HTTP request
An **HTTP request** is a message that a client (usually a web browser) sends to a server to request some kind of action. The request includes a method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that indicates the desired action, a URL that identifies the target of the request, and optionally, additional data to be sent to the server.

## Form
A **form** in the context of web development is a part of a web page that collects information from users for submission to a server. Forms are typically used for actions like user login, registration, and data entry. In HTML, forms are created using the `<form>` element, and they contain `<input>` elements to let users enter data.

In the Flask example provided:

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    # Now you can use the username and password
```

The form isn't shown, but it's implied. The `username` and `password` are expected to be part of the form data in the HTTP POST request. The form would be defined in the HTML of the web page, something like this:

```html
<form method="POST" action="/login">
    <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
    <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Here is the rendered HTML form:

<form method="POST" action="/login">
    <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
    <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<br>

When the user fills out this form and clicks the Submit button, the browser sends an HTTP POST request to the server. The `action="/login"` attribute in the form specifies that the request should be sent to the `/login` URL. The `method="POST"` attribute specifies that this should be a POST request. The data entered into the `username` and `password` fields is included in the request as form data.

In the Flask route, `request.form['username']` and `request.form['password']` extract the username and password from the form data in the request. This data can then be used to authenticate the user, for example.

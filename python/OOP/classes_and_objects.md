## Class
A class is a **model of a real-world entity or concept**, defining the essential ==attributes== (data) and ==behaviors== (methods) that characterize that entity or concept. It represents the template from which individual objects are created.

*To illustrate, consider a "Car" class. This class defines the attributes that are common to all cars, such as the car's brand, model, color, and engine capacity. It also defines the car's behaviors, such as accelerating, braking, and turning.*

## Object
An object is a specific, concrete instance of a class, representing **an actual entity or concept in the real world**. It embodies the class's attributes and behaviors, but with unique values and actions tailored to its specific identity.

*Continuing the car analogy, a particular car, such as a Toyota Camry, is an object of the "Car" class. This car has a distinct brand, model, color, and engine capacity, representing the values of the class's attributes. It also performs actions, such as accelerating to 60 mph or turning left at an intersection, embodying the class's behaviors.*

## Relationship between Class and Object
The relationship between class and object is analogous to a mold and its cast. The class is the mold, defining the general shape and characteristics of the objects it creates. The object is the cast, a specific instance of the class, taking on unique values and actions tailored to its identity.

The relationship between a class and an object is like a blueprint and a building. A class is like a blueprint - it defines the structure and capabilities that an object will have. Just like a blueprint outlines the structure and functionality of a building, but isn’t a building itself. An object is like a building - it’s an instance of the class, brought to life with actual data. Just like a building is a physical instance of the blueprint, filled with furniture, people, and purpose.

## Attributes
Attributes, also known as fields or instance variables, represent the **data or properties that describe an object**. They store the essential information that makes an object unique and distinguishes it from other objects of the same class.

*For instance, a "Student" class might have attributes such as name, age, major, and GPA.*

## Methods
Methods, also known as functions or behaviors, represent the **actions or operations that an object can perform**. They encapsulate the specific tasks or functionalities that an object is designed to perform. Attributes provide the data that methods act upon, while methods **manipulate or transform the data stored in attributes.**

*The Student class might have methods like `take_exam`, and `print_profile`, These methods enable students to perform actions related to their academic performance.*

# Flask Project structure

A typical Flask project has a specific structure to organize different types of files. Here's a basic outline:

```
- YourProject/
    - app.py
    - static/
        - css/
            - style.css
        - js/
            - script.js
        - img/
            - image.jpg
        - video/
            - video.mp4
    - templates/
        - index.html
        - layout.html
    - tests/
        - test_app.py
    - data/
        - data.csv
        - data.json
    - requirements.txt
    - .venv/
    - .gitignore
```

Here's what each part is for:

- `app.py`: This is the main Python file that includes your Flask application code.

- `static/`: This directory contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos. Flask automatically serves files from this directory at `/static`.
    - `css/`: This directory contains Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files.
    - `js/`: This directory contains JavaScript files.
    - `img/`: This directory contains image files.
    - `video/`: This directory contains video files.

- `templates/`: This directory contains your Jinja2 templates. Flask will look for templates in this directory.

- `tests/`: This directory contains your unit tests.

- `data/`: This directory contains your data files.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all of the Python packages that your app depends on. You could generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

- `.venv/`: This directory contains your Python virtual environment.

- `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project.

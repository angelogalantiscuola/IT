An **HTTP response** is a message that a server sends back to a client in response to an HTTP request. The response contains a status code, headers, and a body which usually contains the requested resource or an error message.

In the context of a Flask application, a response is what your route functions return after processing a request. You can return a variety of things from your route functions, and Flask will convert them into valid HTTP responses.

Here's a basic example of a Flask application returning a response:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

In this example, when the client sends a request to the root URL (`/`), the `home` function is called. This function returns the string 'Hello, World!', which Flask converts into an HTTP response with a 200 status code (indicating success), a `Content-Type` header of `text/html; charset=utf-8`, and a body containing the string 'Hello, World!'.

Flask also provides a `make_response` function that you can use to build a response manually if you need more control over what gets sent back to the client. For example:

```python
from flask import Flask, make_response
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    resp = make_response('Hello, World!', 200)
    resp.headers['X-Something'] = 'A value'
    return resp
```

In this example, the `home` function creates a response with the `make_response` function, sets a custom header on the response, and then returns it. The client will receive this response when it sends a request to the root URL (`/`).

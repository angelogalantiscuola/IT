## Functions in Math

The concept of a function in programming is indeed borrowed from mathematics.

`y=f(x)` for example `9=âˆš3`

- f is the function name (square root)
- x is the input (3)
- y is the output (9)

## Functions in Programming

A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. Functions are fundamental to programming, as they allow you to structure your code in a modular way, making it more organized, reusable, and easier to understand.

In most programming languages, a function is `defined` using a def or function keyword, followed by a `name` of your choice. It can take `parameters` (input values), and return a `result` (output value).

Here's a simple example of a function in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Pippo")
print(result) # Hello Pippo
```

Sure, here are examples of functions in Python that meet your criteria:

- No input and no output:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

- One input and no output:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)
```

- Multiple input and no output:

```python
def greet_personally(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello, " + first_name + " " + last_name)
```

- No input and one output:

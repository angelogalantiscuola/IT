FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), **web framework for building APIs** with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

Building APIs: Building APIs means **creating sets of rules and protocols for external applications to interact with your application**. This involves defining how requests for certain operations should be made, what parameters are needed, how the response will be outputted, and more.


FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for the data parts.

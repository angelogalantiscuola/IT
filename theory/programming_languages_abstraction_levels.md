### Abstraction Levels in Programming Languages

The level of abstraction in programming languages signifies the proximity of a language to the hardware. The lower the level of abstraction, the more the programmer has to grapple with intricate details and low-level operations. Conversely, the higher the level of abstraction, the more features and functionalities the language offers to simplify and automate complex tasks.

- **Machine Code**: This is the lowest level of abstraction. It comprises binary instructions that the processor can execute directly.

- **Assembly Language**: This is a step above machine code. It employs symbolic names for memory locations and operations, replacing binary codes. However, it remains hardware-specific and requires translation into machine code by an assembler.

- **C++**: This high-level language can be compiled into machine code by a compiler. However, compared to other high-level languages, C++ is considered low-level because it permits direct access to memory addresses and low-level operations via pointers. C++ is frequently used to write system software, such as operating systems and compilers.

- **Python**: This language has a higher level of abstraction than C++. It uses an interpreter or a virtual machine to execute its programs. Python provides greater abstraction than C++, including dynamic typing, automatic memory management, multiple paradigms, and built-in data structures. Python is commonly used for scripting, web development, and data analysis.

- **Prolog**: This is among the highest-level languages. It employs logic programming to express problems and solutions in terms of facts and rules, rather than procedures or functions. Prolog abstracts many details, such as control flow, data structures, and algorithms, away from the programmer. It is primarily used for artificial intelligence applications, such as natural language processing and expert systems.

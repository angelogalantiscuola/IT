**Concurrency**
- It is achieved through the interleaving operation of processes on the central processing unit (CPU) or in other words by **context switching**.
- Concurrency can be done using a single processing unit.
- Concurrency **creates the illusion of parallelism**, but actually, the chunks of a task aren’t processed in parallel.

**Parallelism**
- It is achieved through multiple central processing units (CPUs).
- Parallelism cannot be achieved using a single processing unit. It needs **multiple processing units**.
- In parallelism, **tasks are divided into smaller sub-tasks** that are processed seemingly simultaneously or parallel.

**Example**
Concurrency is like a chef who is cooking multiple dishes for a meal. The chef can’t cook all dishes at the exact same time, so they start cooking one dish, then while that dish is simmering, they start preparing another dish. They keep switching between different tasks (chopping vegetables, stirring a pot, etc.) for different dishes. To an observer, it might seem like all dishes are being cooked at the same time, but it’s really the chef switching between tasks for different dishes.

Parallelism, on the other hand, is like having multiple chefs in the kitchen, each cooking a different dish at the same time. Each chef is a separate worker who can make progress on their dish independently of the others. In this case, all dishes are literally being cooked at the same time.

So, concurrency is about one worker (the chef) juggling multiple tasks (cooking different dishes) by switching between them, while parallelism is about multiple workers (multiple chefs) doing different tasks (cooking different dishes) at the same time.

# Sure, here's a complete example of testing a Flask application using pytest, including the Flask app code and the test code.

# Let's start with the Flask application code:

# ```python
# # app.py
# from flask import Flask, jsonify

# app = Flask(__name__)

# books = [
#     {'id': 1, 'title': 'Book 1'},
#     {'id': 2, 'title': 'Book 2'},
#     {'id': 3, 'title': 'Book 3'}
# ]

# @app.route('/books', methods=['GET'])
# def get_books():
#     return jsonify(books)

# @app.route('/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['GET'])
# def get_book(book_id):
#     book = next((book for book in books if book['id'] == book_id), None)
#     if book:
#         return jsonify(book)
#     else:
#         return jsonify({'error': 'Book not found'}), 404

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True)
# ```

# This Flask application has two routes:

# - `/books` (GET): Returns a list of all books.
# - `/books/<int:book_id>` (GET): Returns a specific book by its ID, or a 404 error if the book is not found.

# Now, let's write tests for this Flask application using pytest:

# ```python
# # tests/conftest.py
# import pytest
# from app import app as flask_app

# @pytest.fixture
# def app():
#     yield flask_app

# @pytest.fixture
# def client(app):
#     return app.test_client()
# ```

# In the `conftest.py` file, we define two fixtures:

# - `app`: Returns the Flask application instance.
# - `client`: Returns a test client for the Flask application using the `app` fixture.

# Next, we'll create a test file for the Flask routes:

# ```python
# # tests/test_routes.py
# def test_get_books(client):
#     response = client.get('/books')
#     assert response.status_code == 200
#     assert len(response.json) == 3

# def test_get_book(client):
#     # Test with existing book ID
#     response = client.get('/books/1')
#     assert response.status_code == 200
#     assert response.json['id'] == 1
#     assert response.json['title'] == 'Book 1'

#     # Test with non-existing book ID
#     response = client.get('/books/100')
#     assert response.status_code == 404
#     assert response.json['error'] == 'Book not found'
# ```

# In the `test_routes.py` file, we have two test functions:

# - `test_get_books`: Tests the `/books` route by sending a GET request and asserting that the response has a status code of 200 and contains a list of 3 books.
# - `test_get_book`: Tests the `/books/<int:book_id>` route by sending GET requests with existing and non-existing book IDs. It asserts that the response has the correct status code and data for each case.

# To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` command in your terminal or command prompt:

# ```
# pytest tests/
# ```

# pytest will discover and run all the test functions in the `tests/` directory and its subdirectories.

# The output will look something like this:

# ```
# ============================= test session starts ==============================
# platform linux -- Python 3.9.5, pytest-7.1.2, pluggy-1.0.0

# ============================== 2 passed in 0.02s ===============================

# This example demonstrates how to use pytest to test Flask applications, including setting up fixtures, writing test functions for routes, and running the tests. By leveraging pytest and its integration with Flask, you can write comprehensive and maintainable tests for your Flask applications.

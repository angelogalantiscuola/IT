# Store Of Value Cryptocurrenciesüí≤

As the name suggests, store of value cryptocurrencies are designed to hold or even increase their purchasing power over time

While Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that falls into the store of value category, some would argue that other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin fall under this umbrella as well

## Advantages

the primary advantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that they are **usually much safer investments** compared to other cryptos and they are likely to go up in dollar value over time

now this all depends on whether the store of value crypto in question had something called a fair launch this is where a community collectively starts mining that cryptocurrency from the beginning many cryptos that claim to be a store of value were pre-mined meaning that the team and private investors kept the lion's share of the supply of that crypto

an easy way to check if a store of value crypto is the real deal or not is to **see how its supply is distributed using a blockchain explorer**

## Disadvantages

the primary disadvantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that they **often have very limited functionality**

# üë®‚Äçüíª Smart Contract Cryptocurrenciesüë®‚Äçüíª

Smart contract cryptocurrencies are designed to be programmable with less emphasis on storing value. They make it possible to create tokenized assets and decentralized applications

There are over 5 thousand dApps with millions of users on about two dozen smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains, mainly Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain

## Advantages

smart contract cryptos **get their value from their utility as payment for smart contract and dapps transactions** for ethereum these fees are paid in eth for the binance smart chain these fees are paid in bnb and so on

to make sure there is always enough cryptocurrency on the market to pay for transaction fees most smart contract cryptocurrencies do not have a maximum supply instead they have annual inflation schedules that can go well into the double digits depending on certain network conditions this printing of coins normally isn't a problem if there are enough dapps users buying up the coin to pay the fees required to use them

the primary advantage of smart contract cryptocurrencies is that's that **their value is tied to the size and adoption of the dapps and token ecosystems built on their blockchains**

## Disadvantages

the only problem there is that you don't know which smart contract cryptocurrency will be the winner and that's the primary disadvantage of smart contract cryptos **there is a lot of competition in the smart contract crypto category**

# üîÆOracle CryptocurrenciesüîÆ

Oracle cryptocurrencies make it possible to bring real world data to smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains

The difference between data feeds like APIs and oracle cryptocurrencies is that the data feeds that oracle cryptocurrencies provide are decentralized

the way this normally works is that dozens of individuals or institutions will tell an oracle crypto what the price of something is and the oracle will use the average of their answers

like smart contract cryptocurrency coins oracle crypto tokens are required to pay for the fees associated with fetching this data

now while **chain link is currently the largest and most adopted oracle crypto** on the market there are about a dozen other oracle cryptos

## Advantages

the primary advantage of oracle cryptos is that **the demand for their tokens is likely to grow in tandem with the amount of smart contract** cryptocurrency dapps and users

## Disadvantages

the primary disadvantage of oracle cryptos is that almost **all of them have allocated enormous amounts of their pre-mined token supplies to their teams and private investors** what this means is that when their prices rise there is a huge incentive for those teams and private investors to sell which suppresses the price from going higher than it otherwise would

moreover **most smart contract cryptos use multiple oracles** for their dapps data and some like cardano **have opted to build their own decentralized data oracles** this further dilutes the amount of demand for any single oracle cryptocurrency 

# üí≥Payment Cryptocurrenciesüí≥

Payment cryptocurrencies aim to replace the current payment systems we use today, and sometimes use smart contract technology to do this

Popular payment cryptocurrencies include **Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Terra, and Telcoin**.

## Advantages

the primary advantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that they have the highest chances of achieving mainstream adoption and **the market they're shooting for is the most lucrative on the planet**

## Disadvantages

primary disadvantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that it's extremely unlikely that any payment crypto coin or token will be replacing the regular money we use anytime soon this is in part because **most payment cryptocurrencies don't have a stable price** and also because **governments** have shown us that they will step in to prevent people from using these cryptos as payment

# üîèPrivacy Cryptocurrenciesüîè

Privacy cryptocurrencies are designed to preserve your privacy when making transactions or using dApps

- **secret network** make it possible to create privacy preserving dapps
- **tornado** cash make it possible to privatize your public transactions on ethereum by mixing up your funds
- **monero** and **zcash** focus on private payments
- **haven protocol** that makes it possible to mint synthetic fiat currencies cryptocurrencies and precious metals to create an untraceable digital offshore bank account

## Advantages

the primary advantage of privacy cryptocurrencies is that most of them are extremely **well designed** and built to last many of them also had a **fair launch**

## Disadvantages

the primary disadvantage of privacy cryptos is that they're frequently **targeted by regulators** because of their use in illicit activities this often results in privacy coins being delisted from cryptocurrency exchanges which makes them hard to get

# üìäExchange Tokensüìä

Exchanges tokens are owned and operated by the cryptocurrency exchanges they belong to. 

You can think of exchange tokens as being a combination of a membership subscription and company stock

Exchange tokens are like a membership subscription because they can give you a whole bunch of perks such as trading fee discounts and VIP access to early coin and token sales

Exchange tokens are like company stock because the performance of an exchange token depends on the popularity of the exchange in question

## Advantages

the primary advantage of exchange tokens is that they are **highly likely to go up in price**

## Disadvantages

the primary disadvantage of exchange tokens is that **their gains do not come nearly as quickly as other cryptocurrencies nor are these gains completely guaranteed** as cryptocurrency exchanges become more and more powerful regulators are slowly starting to push back

# üê∂Meme Coinsüê∂

Most meme coins have no specific use case and exist for no other reason besides hype and a false promise of profit

Many of the meme coins you‚Äôve seen pop up over the last few months have similarly massive supplies, which means they won‚Äôt be reaching 1 dollar any time soon either

Most meme coins exist for one purpose, and that‚Äôs to enrich their creators. You can try your luck riding that wave, but the risk is not worth the reward in my personal opinion.

## Advantages

the primary advantages go meme coins do in fact offer an easy way to make a quick buck

## Disadvantages

the primary disadvantage is that you never know when the pump will come or when it will end and the likelihood that you'll come out in profit when the dust settles is slim to none this is because meme coins are the most manipulated cryptocurrencies on the market

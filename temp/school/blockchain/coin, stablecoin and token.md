# Coin, stablecoin and token

Coins are native to their own blockchain. Whilst tokens have been built on top of another blockchain, like Ethereum, NEO, or Waves.

Meanwhile, tokens serve a different purpose. If they were created to be used on a dApp, then their purpose will depend on the application itself. In some cases, they are for features such as voting rights. In other cases, they are used for transactions on the dApp (like Civic) or to reward the users with things like discounted fees, etc. (like Binance).

Coins are cryptocurrencies that are native to their own blockchains notable examples include btc for bitcoin eth for ethereum and xmr for monero coins 

- are used to pay fees on their native network
- are used to transfer value
- are given as rewards to miners when a new block is mined

By contrast tokens do not have their own native blockchains and can even exist on multiple blockchains.

take cream finance's cream token for example it exists as an erc20 token on ethereum and is also a bep20 token on the binance smart chain instead of being used for baseline network activities like fee payments tokens often have unique use cases that are specific to the projects that made them.

One of the best examples is Decentraland's mana token which is burned to purchase digital assets on the Decentraland marketplace.

## Coin

- All the “coins” exist as data on a giant global database. This database (or blockchain) keeps track of all the transactions and is checked and verified by computers around the world.
- Digital coins are generally used in the same way as a real-life coin is – as money.
- However, some digital coins (such as Ether, NEO, and DASH) have more features than just being useful as a form of money.

## Stablecoin

These are cryptocurrencies that are pegged one for one to the value of another asset. In most cases, this is a fiat currency like the US dollar

- The first is decentralized stablecoins that rely on collateralized debt and smart contracts to maintain their peg
    - makerDAO
- The second are centralized and fiat backed stablecoins that hold a certain amount of cash in a bank in order to make sure the currency is backed one to one
    - USDT most popular but controversial
    - USDC is a better alternative

### Purpose

- Since the value of the stablecoin experiences little fluctuation, a crypto holder can mitigate their losses during a bear market by turning their unstable cryptos into stablecoins and wait out the market
- Another use for stablecoins is for payments across borders, if you would like to send someone USD who lives in another country, the fees for sending stablecoins are generally far lower than if you were to send a fiat money transfer.

## Token

- Tokens are created on existing blockchains.
- Tokens that are built on the Ethereum platform are known as ERC-20 tokens.
- tokens on the Ethereum platform are known as ERC-20 tokens, NEO uses tokens known as NEP-5 tokens.

### Fees

- For example, if the token is being created on Ethereum, the creator will need to spend some Ether to get the network’s miners to validate the token transaction (creation).
- It’s important to remember that fees need to be paid for all token transactions on a blockchain, not just the creation of the token. Therefore, any application built on Ethereum must use Ether coins to transfer the application- specific tokens from one user to another or between the app and the user.

### Purposes

- Most tokens exist to be used with decentralized applications, or dApps.
    - Once created, tokens are often used to activate features of the application they were designed for.
    - For example, Musicoin is a token that allows users to access different features of the Musicoin platform. This could be watching a music video or streaming a song.
- Some tokens are created for a whole different kind of purpose: to represent a physical thing. Let’s say you wanted to sell your house using a smart contract. You can’t physically put your house into the smart contract, can you? No. So, instead, you can use a token that represents your house.

### Reason for creating tokens

- Since the developer of a dApp and token doesn’t have to create their own blockchain, it saves them time and resources. They can use the features of cryptocurrency with their application while benefiting from the security of the native blockchain.
- Time isn’t the only thing it saves them — if they created their own blockchain and coin instead of a dApp and token, they would need to find miners to verify their transactions, too.

### Different types of token

- Finally, in our token definition, let’s look at a few different types of tokens. They’re known as Security or Asset Tokens, Payment Tokens, Equity Tokens, and Utility Tokens.

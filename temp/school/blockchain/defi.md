# DeFi

DeFi takes products and services from traditional finance and decentralizes them by replacing middlemen with smart contracts.

In reality the current DeFi ecosystem are pretty heavily centralized the reason why is that many DeFi services or products have a central company behind them creating the smart contracts

<aside>
üí° non-custodial wallets means that you still hold the keys to your crypto and do not trust them with a middleman

It is better to describe DeFi as non-custodial finance where you don't need to trust a third party like a bank with your money

# Smart Contract

## Idea

The blockchain of Bitcoin was designed only for transactions, Alice gives Bob $5 then Bob gives $7 to Charles yada yada yada‚Ä¶. all stored on the blockchain, but Vitalik (co-founder of Ethereum) thought storing only transactions was boring and introduced something known as ‚ÄúSmart Contracts‚Äù.

So Vitalik had an idea üí°, the place in a block where transaction data is stored, he thought of including pieces of code. These pieces of code when put together in a single file would be called Smart Contracts.

## Definition

The smart contract is a program with very specific set of procedures that once deployed no one can change.

Everything that is written in the smart contract will happen exactly without the need of third party to enforce some/all of the clauses if one of the parties change his mind.

## Example of Smart Contract

In short: you own a digital token like bitcoin token and a property like a car can be used/unlocked only by that token. 

You don't need a deed to own it. 

You can send it to another person and the ownership changes.

Same concept for stocks, autonomous corporations etc... You can have contracts that execute under certain conditions like transfer of ownership if an event happens

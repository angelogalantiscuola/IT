# Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

<aside>
üí° Layer 2 solutions are designed to increase the speed and efficiency of blockchains.

### Problem

- Each transaction must be accepted, mined, distributed, and validated by a global network of nodes.
- **Scaling problems are an issue** when the amount of data passing through the blockchain hits a limitation due to the insufficient capacities of the blockchain.

### Layer 1 solutions

- Layer 1 blockchain solutions help to improve the base protocols (E.g. Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work, or PoW) by changing how they operate as regards processing data.
- For example, the Ethereum network is now moving to a **proof-of-stake (PoS)** consensus algorithm.
- **Sharding** is another layer 1 scaling solution that breaks down the job of authenticating and validating transactions into smaller pieces.
- Layer 2 solutions to scaling establish an additional protocol that is built on top of blockchains like those of Ethereum and Bitcoin.
- Layer 2 scaling solutions increase throughput without tampering with any of the original decentralization or security characteristics that are integral to the original blockchain.

### Sidechain

- Sidechains are in fact something of a hybrid between layer 1 and layer 2 solutions to scaling.
- A sidechain is another blockchain that is linked to a main chain such as Bitcoin‚Äôs.
- **One example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network**, attached to Bitcoin‚Äôs main chain.
- Like other layer 2 scaling solutions, it aims to tackle scalability problems by offloading some of the validation and transaction processing processes to another blockchain. This frees up the main chain to take on a greater number of transactions.

### Parachains

- Parachains are short for ‚Äúparallel chains.‚Äù As you can imagine, these chains run parallel to one another in a system of interconnected blockchains.
- This is the central idea behind **Polkadot**.
- Parachains allow for very fast transactions as the distribution is efficiently spread to handle workloads.

### Hashgraphs

- Hashgraphs leave the realm of blockchain and are considered a different technology altogether.
- Unlike blockchain, hashgraph has been **patented**, and the only ledger out there that uses it is **Hedera Hashgraph**. Hedera touts itself as the third-generation of public ledger technology, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. It supports incredible scalability at **10,000 TPS**, lower fees, less energy usage and lower processing times.

### Layer 2 solutions

- Layer 2 scaling solutions must inherit the underlying security of the main chain. Whereas sidechains may use other networks or validators to secure the chain, layer 2 differentiates itself by inheriting its security directly from the main chain.
- The main layer 2 solutions are
    - zero-knowledge rollups
    - optimistic rollups
    - plasma
    - Bitcoin Lightning Network

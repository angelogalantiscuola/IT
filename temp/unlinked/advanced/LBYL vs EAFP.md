  
LBYL and EAFP are two different approaches to error handling in programming.

**LBYL** stands for **"Look Before You Leap"**. This approach emphasizes checking for potential errors before attempting an operation. This can be done by using explicit checks, such as if statements, or by using try-except blocks. The goal of LBYL is to prevent errors from happening in the first place.

**EAFP** stands for **"Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission"**. This approach emphasizes not checking for potential errors before attempting an operation. Instead, the code is allowed to fail, and an error handler is used to deal with the failure. The goal of EAFP is to make the code more concise and readable.

```python
def divide_lbyl(x, y):
    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
```

```python
def divide_eafp(x, y):
    try:
        return x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
```

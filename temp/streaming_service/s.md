# Social Media Platform

Imagine a bustling social media platform where users interact with each other in various ways. Users can create posts, comment on these posts, and even like posts or comments. They can also follow other users to keep up with their activities. Each user has a unique username, an email address, a password, and a profile picture.

Posts are a central part of this platform. They contain some content, a timestamp of when they were created, and sometimes a location. Users can comment on posts, like them, or even share them with their followers.

Comments are attached to posts and are also created by users. They contain some content and a timestamp of when they were created. Like posts, comments can also be liked by users.

Users can send messages to each other. Each message contains some content and a timestamp of when it was sent.

There are also groups on this platform. A group contains multiple users and posts. It has a name and a description. Users can be added to or removed from groups. Posts can also be added to or removed from groups.

Pages are similar to groups, but they are managed by a user and can contain advertisements. Each page has a name, a description, and a category.

Advertisements are associated with pages and are created by users. They contain some content, a timestamp of when they were created, and a budget.

Users receive notifications. Each notification contains some content and a timestamp of when it was received.

Users can report posts, comments, messages, or advertisements. Each report contains a reason and a timestamp of when it was submitted.

Your task is to create a UML class diagram for this social media platform. Identify the classes, attributes, and methods from the description above. Remember to use the correct PlantUML syntax for defining classes, attributes, relationships, and methods.

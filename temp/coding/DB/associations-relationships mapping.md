Associations and relationships can be mapped from one to the other, especially when transitioning between UML class diagrams (used in object-oriented design) and ER diagrams (used in database design). Here's how:

One-to-One Association: This can be directly mapped to a one-to-one relationship in an ER diagram.

One-to-Many Association: This can be directly mapped to a one-to-many relationship in an ER diagram.

Many-to-Many Association: In an ER diagram, a many-to-many relationship is typically represented using an associative entity (also known as a bridge table or junction table) to break down the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships.

Aggregation and Composition: These are specific types of associations in UML that indicate a whole-part relationship. They don't have a direct equivalent in ER diagrams, but can be represented as a one-to-many relationship, with the whole as the one side and the parts as the many side.

Inheritance (a.k.a. Generalization): In UML, a subclass can inherit attributes and operations from a superclass. In an ER diagram, this can be represented using category (or subclass) entities.

In Python, context managers are a way to manage resources in a controlled manner. They are used to ensure that resources are properly opened, used, and closed, even if there are exceptions.

Context managers are typically implemented as classes that define two special methods:

- `__enter__()`: This method is called when the with statement is entered. It is responsible for setting up the resource to be used.
- `__exit__()`: This method is called when the with statement is exited. It is responsible for cleaning up the resource, including closing files, releasing locks, and resetting any other state.

For example, the following code opens a file, writes some text, and then closes the file:

```python
with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
```

The `open()` function returns a context manager that automatically closes the file when the with statement is exited.

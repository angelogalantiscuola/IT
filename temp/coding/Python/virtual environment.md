A Python virtual environment is a tool that helps to **keep dependencies required by different projects separate** by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. It’s a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different sets of packages and different configurations.

Here’s a brief explanation of its main components:
- **Isolated Environment**: Each virtual environment contains a discrete copy of the Python interpreter, including copies of its support utilities. This isolation helps to avoid conflicts between different versions of libraries used in different projects.
- **Package Management**: When used from within a virtual environment, common installation tools such as pip will install Python packages into the virtual environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly. This allows each project to have its own directory to store third-party packages.
- **Portability and Reproducibility**: Virtual environments are considered disposable – it should be simple to delete and recreate it from scratch. This makes it easier to share your project with others, as you can provide a list of the exact versions of the packages your project depends on.

# Hypervisor

## what is an hypervisor?
A hypervisor is a type of software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine by virtually sharing the hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 hypervisors run directly on the host machine's hardware, while Type 2 hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system.

## Diffence betwen type 1 and type 2 hypervisors
Type 1 hypervisors run directly on the host machine's hardware, while Type 2 hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system. Type 1 hypervisors are also known as "bare-metal" hypervisors because they run directly on the host's hardware, while Type 2 hypervisors are also known as "hosted" hypervisors because they run on top of an existing operating system. Type 1 hypervisors are generally more efficient and secure because they have direct access to the hardware, while Type 2 hypervisors are easier to install and manage because they run on top of an existing operating system.

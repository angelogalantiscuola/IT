# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. It tracks changes made to files in a **repository** so you can see what was changed, who changed it, and why. Git is widely used in software development, and it's the foundation for services like GitHub and GitLab.

## Why use Git?

- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. This makes it an essential tool for team-based software projects.

- **Version Control**: Git keeps track of every change made to a project. This means you can see what changes were made, who made them, and why. If something goes wrong, you can easily revert to a previous version of the project.

- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows you to create separate branches to work on different features or bugs. Once you're done, you can merge your changes back into the main project. This makes it easier to organize your work and keep the main project stable.

- **Distributed System**: Every user has a complete copy of the project, including the entire history. This means you can work on a project without needing a constant internet connection, and it provides a backup in case the central server fails.

- **Integration with Other Tools**: Git works well with other development tools. For example, it's integrated into many IDEs and text editors, and it's the foundation for popular web-based services like **GitHub** and GitLab.

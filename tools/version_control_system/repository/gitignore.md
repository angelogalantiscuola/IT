# .gitignore

In a `.gitignore` file, you typically include files and directories that you don't want Git to track. This often includes:

- **System files**: These are files that your operating system might create
  - **Linux**: Linux distributions might create a variety of temporary or backup files. For example, some text editors like `vim` create backup files that end with a tilde (`~`), so you might include `*~`.
  - **Windows**: Windows creates `Thumbs.db` and `Desktop.ini` for custom folder attributes and thumbnail caches. So, you might include these in your `.gitignore` file.

- **Language-specific files**: For Python, this might include `__pycache__` directories, `.pyc` files, and `.pyo` files.

- **Environment files**: If you're using a virtual environment, you might include `.venv/` or `venv/` (see [virtual environment](virtual_environment.md)).

- **Build files**: If your project involves a build process, you might include the output directory, like `dist/` or `build/`.

- **Configuration files**: Files that contain sensitive information, like [.env](env_file.md) files that contain environment variables, should be ignored.

- **IDE/Editor files**: Temporary files or user-specific files created by your code editor or IDE, like `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.

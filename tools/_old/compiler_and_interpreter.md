# Compiler and Interpreter

- **Compiler**: A compiler is a tool that **translates source code** written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language), typically a lower-level language like machine code. The output of a compiler is an **executable file** that can run independently of the original source code. The entire source code is compiled at once and errors, if any, are shown after the compilation process.

- **Interpreter**: An interpreter is a tool that **executes source code line by line**, translating each statement from the source language into machine code and executing it immediately. Unlike a compiler, an interpreter does not produce an independent executable file. Instead, the source code must be present each time the program is run. Errors are shown as soon as they occur during the interpretation process.

## Advantages of using a compiler over an interpreter

- **Efficiency**: Compiled programs often run more quickly and use resources more efficiently than interpreted programs because they are translated directly into machine code.

- **Executable Files**: Compilers produce an executable file that can be run independently of the original source code. This makes it easier to distribute and run the program on other machines.

- **Error Checking**: Compilers check the entire program for errors before creating the executable. This means that all syntax errors are found before the program is run.

- **Protection of Source Code**: Since the executable file doesn't require the source code to run, the original source code can be kept confidential. This is important if you want to protect your code from being viewed or modified by others.

## Advantages of using a interpreter over an compiler

- **Ease of Debugging**: Interpreters execute the program line by line and stop when they encounter an error, making it easier to debug the code.

- **Dynamic Typing**: Interpreted languages often support dynamic typing, which allows for more flexibility in coding.

- **Platform Independence**: Since the code is interpreted at runtime, it can be executed on any platform that has the appropriate interpreter. This makes interpreted languages more portable.

- **Ease of Modification**: Interpreted code can be modified while the program is running, which is useful for development and testing. This is not possible with compiled languages, as any changes require recompilation.

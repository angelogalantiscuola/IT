## What tools are needed for programming?

For programming, you need a text editor or an integrated development environment (**IDE**) like Visual Studio Code, **a compiler or an interpreter** for the programming language you are using, and a **version control system** like Git to keep track of changes to the code. Additionally, it might be useful to have a basic knowledge of the **syntax of the programming language** you are using and of program flow control structures like loops and conditions.

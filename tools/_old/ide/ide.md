An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE typically consists of a:

- source code editor: for writing and editing code
- build automation tools: for compiling and building the software
- debugger: for testing and debugging the software

Most modern IDEs also offer:

- intelligent code completion: for suggesting code completions
- linting: for identifying and fixing errors in the code
- refactoring tools: for restructuring and improving the code

Examples of IDEs include **Visual Studio Code**, PyCharm, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.

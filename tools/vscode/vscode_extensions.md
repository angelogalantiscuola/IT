## Linter

A linter is a tool that analyzes source code to identify errors, stylistic issues, and potential bugs.
It is a **static code analysis tool**, which means that it analyzes the code without actually executing it.

Benefits of using a linter:

- Improved code quality: Linters can help to identify and fix errors and stylistic issues in your code, which can make your code more readable, maintainable, and bug-free.
- Reduced development time: Linters can help to catch errors early in the development process, which can save you time and effort later on.
- Increased consistency: Linters can help to enforce coding standards and conventions, which can make your code more consistent and easier to understand.

### Python linters

- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/): Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool that checks for errors, potential bugs, and code smells. It can also enforce coding standards and conventions.
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): Flake8 is a Python static code analysis tool that checks for errors, potential bugs, and code smells. It can also enforce coding standards and conventions.

#### Pylint vs Flake8

- Pylint is more comprehensive than Flake8, and it checks for a wider range of errors and stylistic issues.
- Pylint is also more configurable than Flake8, and you can customize it to meet your specific needs.
- Pylint is more opinionated than Flake8, and it has a stricter set of rules. This can be a good thing, as it can help to enforce consistency in your code. However, it can also be a bad thing, as it can be difficult to customize Pylint to meet your specific needs.

## Formatters

A formatter is a tool or program that takes data as input and arranges it in a specific format for output.
Formatters can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Converting data** from one format to another: For example, a CSV formatter can convert a CSV file to a JSON file.
- **Prettifying data**: For example, a code formatter can indent and align code to make it more readable.
- **Validating data**: For example, an HTML formatter can check that an HTML file is well-formed.

Different formatters:

- **Code formatters**: Prettify code by indenting and aligning it. Examples include **Black**, Prettier, and clang-format.
- **Data formatters**: Convert data from one format to another. Examples include CSV Formatter, JSON Formatter, and XML Formatter.

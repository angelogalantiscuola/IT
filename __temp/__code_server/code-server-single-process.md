Yes, the previous setup involves running a separate instance (process) of code-server for each student. This ensures isolation and dedicated resources for each user but can be resource-intensive.

To optimize and potentially reduce resource usage, you can consider the following alternatives:

### 1. **Single code-server Instance with Multiple Workspaces**

You can run a single instance of code-server and configure it to support multiple workspaces. Each student can have their own workspace within the same code-server instance.

### 2. **Containerization**

Use containers (e.g., Docker) to run isolated instances of code-server. This can help manage resources more efficiently and provide better isolation.

### Single code-server Instance with Multiple Workspaces

Here's how you can set up a single code-server instance with multiple workspaces:

1. **Install code-server**: As before.

2. **Create user directories**: Create a directory for each student.

3. **Configure code-server**: Run code-server with a configuration that supports multiple workspaces.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Install code-server

```sh
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

#### 2. Create user directories

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /home/code-server-workspaces/student1
sudo mkdir -p /home/code-server-workspaces/student2
# Repeat for each student
```

#### 3. Configure and run code-server

Create a configuration file for code-server:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/code-server/config.yaml
```

Add the following content:

```yaml
bind-addr: 0.0.0.0:8080
auth: password
password: your_password
cert: false
```

Run code-server with the configuration:

```sh
code-server --config /etc/code-server/config.yaml
```

#### 4. Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx

Install Nginx:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Configure Nginx to proxy requests to the appropriate workspace. Edit the Nginx configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_server_domain_or_IP;

    location /student1/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
        proxy_set_header X-Workspace /home/code-server-workspaces/student1;
    }

    location /student2/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
        proxy_set_header X-Workspace /home/code-server-workspaces/student2;
    }

    # Repeat for each student
}
```

Restart Nginx:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Summary

- Install code-server.
- Create directories for each student's workspace.
- Configure and run a single instance of code-server.
- Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate workspace.

Each student can now access their own workspace within the same code-server instance via `http://your_server_domain_or_IP/student1/`, `http://your_server_domain_or_IP/student2/`, etc. This setup reduces the number of running processes and can be more resource-efficient.
